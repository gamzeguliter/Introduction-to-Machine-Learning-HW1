For Question 2:
 - In order to load test data, you need to write file name to the csv reader in line 100. The accuracy that it
   gives the accuracy I got after backward elimination. In order to use all features, you have to change the lines 18 and 110
   where it reads the rows in data.


For Question 3:
 - It takes time to run both bernoulli and multinomial model therefore I suggest TA to uncomment one in each trial. 
 - In order to load test data, you only need to write file name to the csv reader code between lines 50-56. 
 - The output of the code is percentages of accuracy without confusion matrix. 
 - In the code, unfortunatelly, I got lower accuracies than I expected. I had trouble taking the log and 
 couldn't fix the bugs. 
 

Thank you for your time
